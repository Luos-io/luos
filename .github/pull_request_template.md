### Some guidelines to keep in mind
- Colons (:), semi-colons (;), exclamation (!), and interrogation points (?) are not preceded by a space (like full stops and commas). E.g.: Colons!
- File names and/or address are put in *italic*. E.g.: The file _main.c_.
- Functions, variables, or more generally short codes are put between grave accents. E.g.: To obtain `code()`, type \`code()\`.
- Long codes are put into blocks of code with three grave accent on each side, and the language's name:<br />
\`\`\`c<br />
// Some C language <br />
\`\`\`<br />

- "Luos engine" has a upper case on the **L** for "Luos" and lower case on the **e** for "engine".
- We call it "Luos engine" as a proper name, and ***not*** "the Luos engine".
- Following that fashion, anything that's owned by "Luos engine" implies that we must use `'s` as the standard English rule to show the possessive case, e.g. "Luos engine's API".
- The names pipe, gate, inspector, sniffer, app or application, driver, etc. have a lower case and can be refereed with the determiner `the`. E.g.: The inspector.
