# Network topology

The nodes can access the position of every other node in the network at any time, by accessing a specific structure called routing table. The routing table is designed and shared among the nodes after the execution of a devoted process called detection.

This routing table allows any service to find, locate, and use any other service on the entire network.

## [Routing table](../services/routing-table)

The [Routing table](../services/routing-table) is a feature of Luos that enables each <Tooltip def={useDocusaurusContext().siteConfig.customFields.node_def}>node</Tooltip> to possess a "map" (or topology) representing the entire network of your device. This map empowers nodes to understand their physical position, diverse functionalities, and facilitates seamless search and interaction with other nodes.

The [Routing table](../services/routing-table) is created and shared among all nodes through a process known as [detection](../services/routing-table). During detection, each node generates a local routing table that contains a list of its services and connections to their parent node. The node initiating the topology detection consolidates all the local routing tables from other nodes to form a global routing table. By default, the routing table is shared with all nodes.<br/>
However, the routing table is not essential for every node, especially if it only includes driver services. In such cases, you can define `NO_RTB` in the `_node_config.h_` file within your project to save memory.
