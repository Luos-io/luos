# Robus

Robus is a network layer specifically designed by Luos engine. It is used by most of the Luos examples. Here is a list of all the hardware peripherals used to drive the physical bus:

- **PORT**: Defines necessary pins, PTP lines, Rx/Tx, enable/disable.
- **TIMER**: Defines timeouts for communication.
- **COM**: Serial bus.
- **CRC**: Optionaly used to optimize the messages validation. CRC can be generated through hardware or software.
- **DMA**: Optionaly used to optimize the communication.

## PTP Network

PTP is the Point-To-Point connection between nodes used for topology detection by some networks (specially [Robus](./luos-hal#robus-hal)). Every node should have between two to eight PTP connections representing ports. At this time, these wires are mandatory with a Robus network.

### Daisy-chain

With two PTP pins per board, you must chained your device as below:

      dark: '/assets/images/daisy_chain_white.svg',
    }}
  />
</div>

### Star Mounting

With at least three PTP pins per board, you can create a star mounting configuration:

    }}
  />
</div>
