# WebSocket

The Websocket network is the default network used to communicate over a TCP/IP network. You cna use it to run application on both side, computer and embedded system.
Keep in mind that this network is not deterministic and is not made to run real time application. This is a good solution to interact with a web application or a web based application.
Your board will need to be connected to a wifi or ethernet network to be able to communicate with other nodes.
You will have to take care of your network port configuration to be able to communicate with your board.

This network need to connect to a running broker application. The ws Address you will have to configure in your product_config.h file will be the address of the broker.

:::info
To run a broker, please use pyluos and run the `pyluos-ws-broker` command.
