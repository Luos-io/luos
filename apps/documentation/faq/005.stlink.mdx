# I am unable to update my board using ST-Link

## Symptom(s)

When you try to update a card using ST-Link, an error message may appear on platform.io. This error is not expected if platform.io has been successfully installed, but in some specific configurations it may happen.

## Possible explanation

Your ST-Link driver is not installed.

## Resolution
