# I can't complete the get started tutorial because some dependencies are not installed

### Symptom(s)

When you start your first application or follow the Luos's Get started, you may face problems with the environment development installation. This topic explains and guides you through the installation process of these development tools.

### Possible explanation

One of these installations failed or is not up to date:

- Python
- Pip
- VSCode
- PlatformIO

### Resolution

If you have a problem setting up your environment development, check the previous listed softwares are properly installed, as well as the related dependencies. You may need to uninstall and reinstall them one by one. Also check the environment variables are properly set.
Read the following example

### Example

#### Python 3 Installation

For MacOS and Linux Python are pre installed following installation for Windows

##### Step 1: Download Python 3 executable installer

1. Go to the "Downloads for Windows" section of the official Python website.
2. Search for your desired version of Python (version 3.7.3 or higher)
3. Select a link to download either the Windows x86 or x64 executable, according to your configuration.

</div>

Note: If your Windows installation is a 32-bit system, you need the Windows x86 executable installer. If your Windows is a 64-bit version, you need to download the Windows x86-64 executable installer. There is nothing to worry about if you install the “wrong” version. You can uninstall one version of Python and install another.

##### Step 2: Run executable installer

1. Run the Python installer once downloaded. (In this example, we have downloaded Python 3.7.3.).
2. Make sure you select the install launcher for all users and add Python 3 to PATH is checked.
3. Click on Install Now.

</div>

For all recent versions of Python, the recommended installation options include Pip and IDLE. Older versions may not include such additional features.

4. The next dialog will prompt you to select whether to disable path length limit. Choosing this option will allow Python to bypass the 260-character MAX_PATH limit. Effectively, it will enable Python to use long path names.

</div>

The disabled path length limit option will not affect any other system settings. Turning it on will resolve potential name length issues that may arise with Python projects developed in Linux.

#### Installing PIP

Follow the steps outlined below to install PIP on Windows.

##### Step 1: Download PIP _get-pip.py_

Before installing PIP, download the _get-pip.py_ file.

1. Launch a command prompt if it isn't already open. To do so, open the Windows search bar, type "cmd" and click on the icon.
2. Then, run the following command to download the _get-pip.py_ file:
   `curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py`

</div>

If the file isn't found, double-check the path to the folder where you saved the file. The command must be executed in the same folder.

#### Installing VSCode
