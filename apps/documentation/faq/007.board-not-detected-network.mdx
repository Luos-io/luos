# My board is not detected in the network

### Symptom(s)

After flashing a board with PlatformIO and launching a detection, the board is not detected in the Luos network. 

### Possible reason(s)

- The upload function did not work properly in PlatformIO.

### Explanation and resolution

Sometimes, VS Code and PlatformIO do not clean nor regenerate the user folders *.vscode* and *.pio*, and it can affect uploading (or flashing) your code to the board, even if there is a success message after the upload. The clean action does not affect these folders either. 

If you have this detection problem, try the following actions:
- Delete the folder *.pio* from the tree on the left in PLatformIO. 
- In order to have a clean development environment, you can also delete the folder *.vscode* from the tree. 
- Perform a clean (Bin icon in the bottom left of VS Code).
- Try hitting Upload again in the bottom left. 

The deleted folders and their files will be automatically regenerated at upload. Then try to make a detection again, the board should now be detected.

### Example

#### Step 1: Delete the folders

<div align="center">
  <Image src="/img/faq/board-not-detected-in-network-01.png" />
</div>


#### Step 2: Clean and upload your code

<div align="center">
  <Image src="/img/faq/board-not-detected-in-network-02.png" />
</div>

<div align="center">
  <Image src="/img/faq/board-not-detected-in-network-03.png" />
</div>

:::note
The uplaod time may be longer, because the files are regenerated in the folders *.vscode* and *.pio*.
