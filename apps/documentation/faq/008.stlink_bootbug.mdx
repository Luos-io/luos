# I am unable to flash my board with Luos bootloader, when using ST-Link connected gate

## Symptom(s)

When you try to update a Luos board using the bootloader in a network connected with your computer using ST-Link, the process fails during the last step of flashing.

## Possible explanation

This may be a bug from the ST-Link driver occuring with a specific size of messages, and so a specific size of binary files.

## Resolution

Try to connect your gate to your computer using another protocol, like FTDI, and flash again. If it doesn't work, try to resize the _.bin_ file you want to flash, by slightly changing your application's code.
