# I can't upload my Arduino project

## Symptom(s)

When you try to update an Arduino board, an error message may appear in the file _platformio.ini_.

## Possible explanation

This error is related to an upload problem of Arduino, even though you do not have any compilation errors.

## Resolution

You need to restart your Arduino board so that it is ready to be flashed.
Double-push your Arduino's reset button so that it gets in boot mode, and try to relaunch the upload of your firmware.
