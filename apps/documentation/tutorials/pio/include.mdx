# Part 2: Include Luos to your project

## 1. Include the Luos library in your project

The file _platformio.ini_ in your project describes the precompiler variables and the library depencies of your project.

In our case, we want to use Luos-engine as a library. Writing `luos_engine` and the needed networks libs in the section `lib_deps` will download the Luos-engine library from PIO registry and will build and link everything needed by your project.

:::info
Since version 3.0.0 luos-engine is network independent. You can choose the network you want to use by adding the corresponding network library in the section `lib_deps`.
:::

Fill in the file _platformio.ini_ accordingly:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="ST" label="ST">

```ini
build_unflags = -Os
build_flags =
    -O1
    -include node_config.h
    -DUSE_HAL_DRIVER
    -DUSE_FULL_LL_DRIVER
    -DLUOSHAL=STM32F0
    -DROBUSHAL=STM32F0  ;Optional: Luos-engine will try to use the same HAL as LuosHAL if not defined
    -DSERIALHAL=STM32F0 ;Optional: Luos-engine will try to use the same HAL as LuosHAL if not defined
lib_deps =
    luos_engine
    serial_network
    robus_network
debug_tool = stlink
upload_protocol = stlink
```

At the line `LUOSHAL=STM32F0`, we selected Luos HAL for the chosen MCU family (as we use the board STM32F072Rb, it means it is the STM32F0 family).

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Arduino" label="Arduino">

```ini
build_flags =
    -include node_config.h
    -DLUOSHAL=ATSAMD21_ARDUINO
    -DROBUSHAL=ATSAMD21_ARDUINO ;Optional: Luos-engine will try to use the same HAL as LuosHAL if not defined
    -DSERIALHAL=ARDUINO         ;Not optional: Luos-engine will try to use the same HAL as LuosHAL but here HAL don't have the same name.
lib_deps =
    luos_engine
    serial_network
    robus_network
```

At the line `LUOSHAL=ATSAMD21_ARDUINO`, we selected Luos HAL for the chosen MCU family (as we use the board Arduino MKRZero, it means it is the ATSAMD21_ARDUINO family).

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info
You can choose a minimal version that you want for your Library:
`luos_engine@^X.Y.Z` → Minimal version of Luos-engine (writing nothing here will download the last version).
:::

## 2. Include Luos-engine in your main file

At the top of the main file, add `#include "luos-engine.h"` and the network libs you want. With this line, you just added Luos-engine library to your project so that you can use Luos API.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="ST" label="ST">

```c
#include "stm32f0xx_hal.h"
#include "luos_engine.h"
#include "robus_network.h"
#include "serial_network.h"

...

int main(void)
{
    // Init
    HAL_Init();
    Luos_Init();
    Robus_Init();
    Serial_Init();

    // Loop
    while (1)
    {
        Luos_Loop();
        Robus_Loop();
        Serial_Loop();
    }
}

...
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Arduino" label="Arduino">

```c
#include <Arduino.h>
#include "luos_engine.h"
#include "robus_network.h"
#include "serial_network.h"

void setup()
{
    Luos_Init();
    Robus_Init();
    Serial_Init();
}

void loop()
{
    Luos_Loop();
    Robus_Loop();
    Serial_Loop();
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Either Luos-engine library or any other Luos-engine packages or network that you will create or add have two special functions: `Init()` and `Loop()`.

-Init function is called once, at MCU boot.
-Loop function will be called sequentially in a loop.

:::info
Each API begins with the name of the file where it is declared. A simple rule of coding, but very convenient.
:::

## 3. Include Luos PTP interruption

In the case that you have a network, you need a way to detect other MCUs in this network. With the Luos network, we use two pins (see the documentation page [topology and network](/docs/luos-technology/node/topology) for more information).

Those special pins, called PTP pins, are necessary for the topology detection. They need an interruption handler to work on a Luos network.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="ST" label="ST">

1. Open the file _stm32xx_it.c_
2. fill in the end of the file with the following code:

```c
/******************************************************************************/
/* STM32F0xx Peripheral Interrupt Handlers                                    */
/* Add here the Interrupt Handlers for the used peripherals.                  */
/* For the available peripheral interrupt handler names,                      */
/* please refer to the startup file (startup_stm32f0xx.s).                    */
/******************************************************************************/
void EXTI4_15_IRQHandler(void)
{
  HAL_GPIO_EXTI_IRQHandler(GPIO_PIN_8);
  HAL_GPIO_EXTI_IRQHandler(GPIO_PIN_13);

}
```

:::info
This is the default configuration of F0 Family used for the STM32F072RB (see [_LuosHAL_Config.h_](https://github.com/Luos-io/luos_engine/tree/main/engine/HAL)). If you need to adapt you hardware, put your changes in the file _node_config.h_ in your project.
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Arduino" label="Arduino">
For Arduino, Luos fills in this information for you.

:::warning
You have to follow the pinout declared in the file _LuosHAL_Config.h_ for ATSAMD21\*ARDUINO in the [HAL folder](https://github.com/Luos-io/luos_engine/tree/main/engine/HAL).

## 4. Compile your Luos project

As you can see in the terminal when you build your project, PlatformiIO will download the last version of the Luos library from its registry, and add it as a library to your project.

<div align="center">
  <Image sources={{ light: '/assets/images/tutorials/pio/pio-2-1.png' }} />
</div>

Upload the code to your MCU by clicking on the right arrow button at the bottom of the IDE.

<div align="center">
  <Image sources={{ light: '/assets/images/tutorials/pio/pio-2-2.png' }} />
</div>

You have now created a project with an ST framework or with an Arduino framework, and configured everyting to begin with Luos.

Rename your project and add packages like in the trainings, in order to make great projects with Luos! [You can check the full solution here](https://github.com/Luos-io/morse_encoder).
