  desc="Since the beginning of this training, you discovered how to create services, deal with messages, or control them using Pyluos. But you never created embedded application service using other services yet. It is time for you to go to the next stage and learn how to use your new superpowers!"

In the previous training, we created a LED and a button services to control them using Pyluos.

We will reuse those services and create our first fully embedded application able to detect the topology of our system and use the available services in it.
