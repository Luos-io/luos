A button can be represented (as a LED) by a state-type service. But contrary to the LED, the button will have to send a state value instead of receiving it.

A button service only has to manage a button, so it is kind of dumb! Your button service doesn't know where it needs to send its value, that's why you will have to program a reaction from an external request.

Your button service will have to receive a request message asking for the state of the button, then the service will have to send the state's value back to the asking service.
