In the Get started tutorial, we learned to perform the following essential actions:

1. Set up the embedded environment to make a basic Luos-LED-blinking project.
2. Control of your microservices with high-level API and set up the Python environment.
3. How to spread microservices across multiple boards on a network while keeping the exact same behavior with Luos engine.

Upon finishing the _Get started_, you can grab what a microservice represents into an embedded system. However, Luos still remains black magic to you.

Let us demystify it by helping you to make first service code!
