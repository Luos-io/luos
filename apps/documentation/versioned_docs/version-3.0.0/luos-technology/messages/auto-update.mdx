# Time-triggered auto-update messages

Luos engine provides a standard command to ask a service to retrieve values from a service, called `ASK_PUB_CMD`. However, sometimes apps need to poll values from sensors, but the act of repeatedly retriving a value using the `ASK_PUB_CMD` command may result in the use of a lot bandwidth and take up valuable resources.
In this kind of polling situation, **you can use the time-triggered auto-update features available from any Luos engine service**. This feature allows you to ask a service to send you an update of any value each X milliseconds.
To use it, you have to setup targeted service with a message containing a standard time <Tooltip def={useDocusaurusContext().siteConfig.customFields.od_def}>object dictionary</Tooltip>, but with a specific command associated to it.

For example, to update a service each 10 ms:

```c
time_luos_t time = TimeOD_TimeFrom_ms(10);
msg_t msg;
msg.header.target = id;
msg.header.target_mode = SERVICEIDACK;
TimeOD_TimeToMsg(&time, &msg);
msg.header.cmd = UPDATE_PUB;
Luos_SendMsg(app, &msg);
```

:::info
Services can handle only one time-triggered target, 2 services of the same network can't ask a time-triggered value from the same service.
:::

:::caution
To prevent any ID movement, auto-update configuration is reset on all services on each detection (see [Routing table page](../node/topology) for more information).
