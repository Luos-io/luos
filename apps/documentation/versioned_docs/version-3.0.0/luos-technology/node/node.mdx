# Node

A Luos node is the term that corresponds to each executed programs connected to a Luos network.

:::note
In the case of microcontrollers, because they run only one executable binary, Luos users frequently talk about microcontroller as nodes.
:::

In other words, each program connected into the system, is called a node. The node contains packages running services or phys, concepts that are going to be analyzed in the following pages.

The nodes are described by a set of characteristics that are unique and give them the opportunity to be separated the one from the other. These are:

- **node_id**: node's unique id
- **connection**: a physical connection between the node and it's parent. The parent node is the one that initiated the local node detection. Node only have 1 parent except for the one that initiated the detection, which has none.

Each node hosts the Luos_engine lib and use it to communicate with other nodes and services trough <Tooltip def={useDocusaurusContext().siteConfig.customFields.phy_def}>phys</Tooltip>. The Luos HAL ([Hardware Abstraction Layer](./luos-hal.mdx)) allows to specify how to access Luos needed resources of the physical computing unit, such as time and memory.
