    "DSeVJmGnL80v": "Using Luos at your development stage is the best case scenario: Luos can help you conceptualize your embedded architecture step by step, so that it is scalable, updateable and connected. You will benefit from the flexibility of a microservices approach and save a lot of development time later on.",
    "YHRX2mI2KLfO": "Using Luos at your development stage has several advantages: you won't have to redevelop the whole product again and you will be able to compare your architecture with and without Luos. Luos will allow you to reuse existing code blocks, compare them and iterate them at each stage of your development. Once Luos is deployed, you will save time and money during the development phase.",
    "X9iD8Ee77xmN": "Using Luos during your development stage will require some code rework, but the benefits are worth it. If you run into obstacles during the development of your prototype, Luos can solve those problems and make your product more \"future-proof.\" Implementing Luos will allow you to test, modify and iterate your MVP and prototypes. As a result, your product will be more scalable and easier to update.",

As a result, your product will be more scalable and easier to update.",
    "rcmZGUEGitLo": "You are at a code reworking stage. Now is the best time to understand what went wrong with the previous version and fix it from the ground up with Luos. By implementing Luos at this stage you'll be able to reuse your existing code blocks and architecture in a very flexible way. You will save money at development stage and have the opportunity to easily maintain, update and upgrade your product."

    "EzNONsliBolH": "The main purpose of Luos is to make the different MCUs of your product communicate with each other. But even with a single microcontroller, you can benefit from the power of the Luos network. You can still seamlessly connect your product to the cloud or to another device via Wifi, Bluetooth or USB (for example) to manage and control it remotely.",
    "1NF9UAf2WfS6": "You need to build a hardware architecture and Luos is the perfect candidate for that. Connecting all the MCUs of one product is what Luos does best. MCUs sharing the Luos architecture talk to each other as if they were part of the same component. From there, you can rearrange your architecture, exclude or add MCUs, reprogram them on the fly and more. Because of its network-based design, Luos is also the best candidate to communicate with the exchange protocol of your choice. Wifi, USB, serial, CAN, I2C..., you name it: Luos will do the job!",
    "MuBd81WQL2Xt": "Focus on users needs and features first, then comes hardware architecture... You are still at an early stage of your product design. Don't worry, connecting all the MCUs in a product is what Luos does best. When the time comes, Luos will allow you to design your hardware architecture regardless of the software solution you choose."
  },
  "TimuNSjoiNHk": "You are considering developing future extensions or options and again, Luos can help. Luos fits perfectly with continuous integration, development, and deployment (CI/CD) methods by providing scalability, integration and upgrade capabilities to your product. If you are still testing your features or don't want to be stuck with a previous hardware design, Luos can allow you to upgrade your boards regardless of the limitations of the original product.",
  "gzdDUsQ1fbzs": "You need to connect your product to the cloud, a device or to an external network. Lucky for you, connectivity is a key feature of Luos. Since its main purpose is to connect all the MCUs in your product, it is the best candidate to connect to the network protocol of your choice. Ethernet, TCP/IP, Serial, CAN, I2C..., you name it: Luos will do the job. From there, you will be able to integrate third-party solutions, update your MCU on the fly or monitor your product fleet."
